# java-game
 A Java 2-level game called "*Shadow Dimension*", inspired by Stranger Things. The rule
 of the game is simple: follow the level instruction and don't die!
 
In the first level, you only need to reach the 'gate' in order to proceed to the next.
The only life-threatening obstacle in this level is the 'sinkholes' which will inflict
damage upon direct contact.

In the second level, however, you will be faced with enemies, aside from the sinkholes.
To complete this level, you must defeat the boss, which is (to avoid copyrights) Vecna.
Once Vecna is slain, you'll win the game. Good luck.
